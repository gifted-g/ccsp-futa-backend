Description

As a backend developer,
I want to generate and manage JWT tokens after user login,
So that authenticated users can securely access protected endpoints with session tracking.

Work to Be Done

Generate JWT token upon successful login (from /login endpoint)

Include user ID, email, and expiration timestamp in the payload

Use environment-configured secret for signing tokens

Middleware for JWT validation on protected routes

Check token format, signature, and expiry

Reference

Signup/Login flow: SCRUM-10

OTP Verification dependency: SCRUM-12

JWT Library: github.com/golang-jwt/jwt

Example protected route: /get-user-profile

Sign-Off Criteria

JWTs are securely generated on login

Valid JWTs allow access to authorized resources

Middleware is reusable across routes
